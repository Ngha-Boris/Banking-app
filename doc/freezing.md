# Freeze Function Documentation

# Introduction

The freeze function is a feature implemented in the Bank Management System that allows freezing customer accounts to prevent any further transactions or modifications. The function is built using a CSV file as the database to store customer account details.

# Implementation

Data Structure: The customer account details are stored in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. Each row in the file represents a customer account, and each column represents a specific attribute such as account number, account holder name, balance, and freeze status.

CSV File Format: The CSV file is structured with a header row that defines the column names (e.g., "Account Number", "Account Holder Name", "Balance", "Freeze Status"). The subsequent rows contain the actual customer account data.

Freeze Function: The freeze function is implemented as a method in the Bank Management System. When invoked, it performs the following steps:

Validates user input: The function validates the provided account number to ensure it exists in the CSV file.
Updates the freeze status: If the account number is valid, the function locates the corresponding row in the CSV file and updates the freeze status column to indicate that the account is frozen.
Saves changes to the CSV file: After updating the freeze status, the function writes the modified data back to the CSV file, thus persisting the changes.
Error Handling: The freeze function incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle exceptional scenarios, such as invalid account numbers or issues with reading/writing the CSV file. Appropriate error messages are displayed to the user to provide feedback and guidance.

# Database Management

Reading CSV Data: To retrieve customer account details, the Bank Management System reads the CSV file and parses its contents. This can be achieved using libraries or built-in functions available in the programming language used.

Writing CSV Data: After modifying the freeze status or any other customer account information, the Bank Management System writes the updated data back to the CSV file. This involves overwriting the existing file or creating a new file with the modified data.

Backup and Security: It is recommended to maintain regular backups of the CSV file to prevent data loss. Additionally, appropriate security measures should be implemented to protect the CSV file from unauthorized access or manipulation.

# Conclusion

The freeze function in the Bank Management System allows freezing customer accounts using a CSV file as the database. By leveraging the CSV file format, the system can store and retrieve customer account details. The function ensures data integrity and provides a straightforward mechanism for freezing and unfreezing account.
